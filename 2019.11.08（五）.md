０９：１４ 來圖書館，旅行的事情吧  
１１：２６ 早上持續整旅旅行的事情  
吃東西去吧  
１１：５８ 回來。休息一下  

１２：４１ 繼續昨天的東西  
１４：１０ 持續想面試回答  
奇怪，都在看英文ＱＱ  

１７：４０ 應該是小感冒了  
身體不適，早點回去休息一下再繼續 = =|||||  
雖然每次都這樣說，但你回去都沒做  
再給自己一些鼓勵吧  
這就是我要給自己的挑戰啊！！！  


### 說明為什麼想離開前公司的起手式
Here are some specific examples of good answers to explain job moves:

- “I stayed for three years and learned a lot of valuable skills, but I felt
it was time for a new challenge”
- “The company went through a period of struggle and I was laid off”
- “I was recruited out of the company for a better opportunity”


### How to Practice
Think of each answer as a list of points you want to mention. Practice by checking if you hit each point.
