０９：１８ 來圖書館，轉眼間已經 7 號了...  
０９：４５ 旅行的事情吧  

１１：１３ 第一天行程整理到這樣吧  
算是有著落了  

１１：４０ 吃點東西回來了  待會開工  
１２：１２ 開工吧  

１３：１２
- 88. Merge Sorted Array

再繼續吧  
１３：５３
- 912. Sort an Array

１５：１４
- 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

heap sort 的東西再多看看  
```
Max heap 滿足了兩個性質：
1. 父節點一定大於子節點
2. 整個樹的根節點一定是最大值（可以由 1 推出來）

那麼要如何將此Max Heap做排序呢？

Max Heap的特徵是「第一個node具有最大值」，如果要將資料「由小到大」排序，步驟如下：

- 把「第一個node」和「最後一個node」互換位置。
- 假裝heap的「最後一個node」從此消失不見。
- 對「第一個node」進行MaxHeapify()。
- 重複以上步驟，從heap的最後一個node開始，一路往上，直到root，便能得到排好序的矩陣。
```

１７：０４ 抄了一段程式，但我還是沒有弄懂 heap sort  
先這樣吧  待會繼續面試的東西  

１７：５１ 吃東西後回來  
身體狀況真差 = =|||  


１９：５１ Elevator Pitch for Job Seekers: How to Answer "Tell Me About Yourself" In the Interview
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6S0iTZx54

個人覺得，這個範例真的比較好，比起其他 youtube 上的教學回答這問題的，好很多  

２０：４３ Benson 拿到工作了  
感覺有機會是破百的...  
我要加油了  

“I was on your website doing research and I
saw a mention of ____. Can you tell me more about ____?”

### Decide Why You’re Interested in Their Jo
回答為什麼想要申請這工作的起手式
- “I reviewed the job description and I think the role would be a great next step in my career because ____”
- “I’ve heard great things about the company culture and I’m also very interested in the problems your business is solving such as ____”

### Decide the Main Reason You’re Job Searching
“So why are you looking for a new job?”

Example answer:
> “I’m in an active job search after being laid off four months ago. One of the big things I’m hoping to find next is a chance to further develop my leadership. This job seems to require that skill set and offer a chance to grow it further so I was excited to learn more about it.”

Tell them **you’ve enjoyed your role but you feel that you’re ready for an even bigger challenge now.**  <-- 這就是我要的  

“I’m ready for ____.” It sounds positive rather than sounding like a complaint. Examples:
- “I’m ready for a bigger challenge at this point in my career”
- “I’m ready for exposure to a new type of product”
- “I’m ready for more leadership”
- “I’m ready for more decision-making and responsibility”

### 拿 JD 跟自己履歷比較
被問類似的問題時
- “So, what made you feel you’d be a good candidate for this job?”

Your answer:
> “I noticed the job description mentions leading multiple high-impact projects for this group. It’s an area I’ve done a lot with in the past. In my last job I managed the two largest and most complex projects in my department, and I’m eager to continue doing this in my career.”

這樣能讓對方知道，你讀詳細了解 JD，你也有相關經驗

### 兩分鐘自我介紹
- “So, can you tell me about yourself?”
- Or, “can you walk me through your background?”

So you
- need to find a starting point
- tell your story
- and arrive at your current situation.

If you have between one and ten years of experience, I’d recommend
- starting at the moment you graduated and joined the workforce.

> “I graduated with my degree in Finance in 2014 and then...”

Assuming you have some prior work experience, here are a few things to cover:
- How you got started in your current line of work
- Your most impressive accomplishments
- Key career moves you’ve made and why
- Finish by bringing them up to speed on your current situation and goals in this job search

> “Well, my first job after graduating was an Account Management position for a telecom company. I liked the selling aspects of the role, but I wasn’t passionate about the telecom industry. I started looking into sales positions and spoke with a friend about it, who mentioned I should also look into Recruiting because it’s similar. I ended up joining a small biotech Recruiting firm, spending two years with the company while learning the industry, advancing in the organization and taking on internal leadership and mentoring responsibilities too. It’s been a great experience but I feel I’m ready for an even bigger challenge now.”

有 promotions 的經驗也要講出來  
Any time you can show advancement or promotions within a single company is great. Do this if you can. Even if it’s something small like training a few new hires.

２１：４３ 上面影片的那個人的 pdf 不錯  
要讀讀，有點幫助  
先閃人了，圖書館要關了
